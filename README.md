Overview

Flight simulation is a crucial technology for both civil and military aviation, and the aerospace industry. Real-time simulation tools extend across all aspects of aircraft development, from aerodynamics to avionics and image generation systems. Knowledge of flight simulation software is vital for professional developers, educators, and students. 
This repository contains the necessary computer tools including open-source code required for anyone to design and develop a flight simulator.

This is a companion repository written by Professor Dave Allerton, a noted expert with decades of experience developing flight simulators in academia. 
The resources will enable readers to develop their own simulations with readily available open-source software. 
The resources are based upon the Flight Simulation Software book, which contains software taken from operational flight simulators and provides step-by-step guidance on software design, computer graphics, aircraft equations of motion, navigation and flight control systems, and more. 
The book is accompanied by a companion website, containing source code for flight simulation software with the link provided below:

Folders

The PC version folder entails a group of files from different systems of the flight simulator including: the engine model, instructor station, navigation flight display, primary flight display etc.
The eng folder contains files required for the engine model, computing the thrust, fuel flow and other parameters for the aircraft engine.
The ios folder contains the instructor operating station files.
The lib folder includes…
The nfd folder contains the files for the navigation and avionics computer, producing navigation display for the flight simulator.
The rpi1 folder contains…
The pfd folder contains the aircraft primary flight display files.
The visual folder includes…
The MATLAB files folder includes code used to obtain an integrated interface to Mathworks MATLAB software. 
The interface enables students to design and develop prototype aircraft flight control code, where the output of the code is transmitted to the flight simulator to override flight control inputs. 
This external interface between the flight simulator and MATLAB allows rapid prototyping of flight control code in the MATLAB environment without the need to access, develop or recompile the flight simulator software.
