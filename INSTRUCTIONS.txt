1. Download the folder sim/ to C: and the folder sim-include/
2. Copy the files in sim-include/ to /c/msys64/mingw64/include/SIM/ and /c/msys64/usr/include/SIM/

3. install msys from this file msys2-x86_64-20190524.exe
4. Start msys2 from start>msys2>msys2
5. type these commands:

pacman -Syu
pacman -Su

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glfw 

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-freetype

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-ftgl

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libpng

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libzip

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-freealut
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-openal
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-freeglut
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glew
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-opengl

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-mesa
pacman -S cmake
pacman -S gcc
pacman -S base-devel

6. copy files with these names -libglfw3 -libfreetype -libftgl -libpng -libZ -libalut -libopenal from /c/msys64/mingw64/lib/ to /c/msys64/usr/lib/
usually there are 2 files per name, e.g. libalut.a and libalut.dll.a, copy all
7. in msys2 type:
cd c:
cd sim/libs/
make clean
make

cd c:
cd sim/b747x/
make clean
make
8. to run the simulator, in msys2 type 
cd c:
cd sim/b747x/
./b747



The simulator should start immediately.

(Make sure the terminal resolution is set to 1920x1080)

I made a couple of minor changes from the Cranfield and my home versions as it runs without any controls:

    To HOLD (freeze) the simulator, press the space bar - press it again to resume
    To set the flaps, go to Settings/Flaps and enter a value between 0 (UP) and 30 (down)
    To set the gear position, go to Settings/Gear and select up or down

To try it out, set the gear down, set flaps 30 and go to Reposition/Restore and select GAT6.sav

In all other senses, it's the same as the Cranfield software. You can set DIAGNOSTICS to 1 in ios.c (line 36) to see how fast it runs on your PC. It may run slightly slowly with lots of graphics on the IOS because FTGL is very slow. This has been radically improved by my recent software using OpenGL shaders.
